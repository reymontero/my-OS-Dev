   About
  </H3>
  mbrbm is yet another boot loader which fits into first sector of an HDD (MBR). It allows to choose which partition
  to boot and is intended to replace an MBR coming with DOS/Windows. It may boot any primary partition boot
  record below cylinder 1024.
  <P>
  mbrbm is not an operating system loader. I can not boot Linux or Windows directly (thus it is not a replacement of
  LILO/GRUB/ntldr for example), but it can boot an appropriate loader from a boot record of a particular partition
  (again LILO/GRUB/ntldr for instance).
  <P>
  mbrbm's functionality is completely implemented _WITHIN_ the Master Boot Record. It is written in nasm (x86 assembler).
  On boot it displays a primary partition list with type/size and let the user choose the booting partition by
  selecting it by number-keystroke. At timeout the active partition is bootet.
  With no interaction it does exactly what a standard DOS/Windows9x/ME (fdisk /mbr) MBR does.
  <P>
  Restrictions are that it cannot boot via LBA (partitions above cylinder 1024) and extended partitions.
  It's compatible with DOS, Windows(9x,ME,NT,2K,XP,2003,Vista), Lilo, Grub, xBSD, ... partition boot records.
  <P>
  My usage of mbrbm is primary for servers on which i always put a FreeDOS partition for basic diagnostic and recovery tasks,
  regardless whether the server is running Linux, xBSD or Windows.
  There are no driver troubles with DOS accessing the disks, raid, ... the BIOS takes care of it.
  There are lots of good tools for hardware diagnostic, partition recovery and the like running on FreeDOS.
  <P>
  With mbrbm i have always a spare boot option without complicated boot manager setups - the standard boot
  method setup of the target OS living in the second or third partition works out of the box with the standard
  installation procedure of the server OS - no hassle with lilo, grub or BOOT.INI configuration after the installation.
  And the best part is that i need no documentation of a complicated setup for the other system administrators.
  This scenario did save my life a few times. Therefore i share it here.

  The mbrbm project is intended to be used by advanced users on their desktop computers. If you have several operating
  systems and want to be able to boot either of them, you may use mbrbm. It is a replacement of the default boot loader
  in MBR which for instance could be written there by Microsoft Windows installation. The whole installation is just
  the writing the very first 438 bytes of the first harddisk with the assembled code of mbrbm.S - the MBR.
  THERE IS NO CONFIGURATION - INSTALLATION -> DONE.
  <BR>
  <P>
<pre>
FULL BACKUP IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
PROCEED ONLY IF YOU REALLY KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING HERE
YOU NEED A WORKING PARTITION BOOT SECTOR FOR EVERY
OPERATING SYSTEM YOU WANT TO BOOT

Compilation of the mbr (or take the compiled version for the distribution archive):
[root@mbrbm /etc]# cd /etc
[root@mbrbm /etc]# nasm mbrbm.S -o mbrbm.bin

Installation with Linux on first IDE Harddisk (use /dev/sda for SCSI):
[root@mbrbm /etc]# cd /etc
[root@mbrbm /etc]# dd if=/dev/hda of=hda.mbr bs=1b count=1
[root@mbrbm /etc]# dd if=mbrbm.bin of=hdambrbm.mbr bs=1 count=438
[root@mbrbm /etc]# dd if=hda.mbr bs=1 skip=438 count=74 >>hdambrbm.mbr
[root@mbrbm /etc]# dd if=hdambrbm.mbr of=/dev/hda bs=1b count=1
[root@mbrbm /etc]# # KEEP THE FILE /etc/hda.mbr AS BACKUP OF ORIGINAL MBR

Deinstallation with Linux on first IDE Harddisk:
[root@mbrbm /etc]# dd if=/etc/hda.mbr of=/dev/hda bs=1b count=1

Installation with FreeDOS on first Harddisk:
C:\> C:
C:\> CD \
C:\> FDISK /SMBR 1
C:\> COPY BOOT.MBR hda.mbr
C:\> COPY mbrbm.bin BOOT.MBR
C:\> FDISK /AMBR 1
C:\> : KEEP THE FILE C:\hda.mbr AS BACKUP OF ORIGINAL MBR

Deinstallation with FreeDOS on first Harddisk:
C:\> COPY hda.mbr BOOT.MBR
C:\> FDISK /AMBR 1

   Frequently asked questions (FAQ)
  </H3>
  <I>Q1</I>: Yet another boot manager? What are the advantages of mbrbm over others?
  <BR>
  <I>A1</I>: mbrbm is first choice if you want an operating system independent boot manager without configuraton.
  Unlike grub, lilo or ntldr(BOOT.INI) mbrbm does not need a working (booting) operating system partition.
  It's whole functionality is within the MBR.
  It will not fail to boot your secondary operating system if you completely destroy the primary.
  In fact there is no more a primary or secondary OS.
  In effect complexity is dramatically reduced from the bootstrapping system.
  The OS's on the system are just installed with their default booting schema.
  No configuration afterwards is needed. No hassle with lilo.conf, grub.conf or confusing BOOT.INI magic.
  <P>
  Consider a situation when you have 2 primary partitions: one with Windows XP and another one with Linux.
  What are your options to boot either of them?
  Using LILO which is able to boot both OSes you will loose an ability to normally boot a system to Windows XP
  if you completely fill Linux partition by zeroes.
  The same with standard DOS + loadlin or Windows ntldr + BOOT.INI executables.
  In this case you should not break Windows partition otherwise you will loose an ability to load Linux.
  <P>
  Of course there are many other third-party managers which are not parts of the operating systems above.
  Several alternatives to mbrbm are listed in <A href="#Links">Links section</A>.
  However almost all of them require either separate partition (like OS/2 boot manager)
  or a directory in FAT partition (like PQBoot) or occupy almost the whole track #0 on cylinder #0
  (it is unused on most systems).
  mbldr (Master Boot LoaDeR) needs to be configured, what has to be redone when booting partitions are added or moved.
  bm uses also parts of track #0 - nuni can only boot IDE drives and needs source code configuration.
  All these solutions add complexity to the bootstrap setup - complexity is the biggest enemy of availabilty and security!
  mbrbm requires only the space which is reserved for the master boot loader by definition, only 438 bytes of 1st sector are used.
  <P>
  Nevertheless there are some drawbacks: the extreme simplicity leads to low quality of user interface
  (only text with minimum usability), less features could be included: no lba and extended partitions can be bootet.
  <P>
  <I>Q2</I>: Compilation breaks with "error: argument to ORG should be numeric" message in mbrbm.err. What am I doing
  wrong?
  <BR>
  <I>A2</I>: The version of nasm required to build mbrbm is greater or equal to 0.98.36. Release .35 which is often
  shipped in many popular (but rather old) distributions could not be used.
  <P>
  <I>Q3</I>: When trying to update the MBR contents on /dev/ad0 under BSD I get "Operation not permitted" error. How to
  overcome this?
  <BR>
  <I>A3</I>: This protection of BSD is active because hard disk is available for writing at the moment. Try to issue a
  command "sysctl kern.geom.debugflags=16" to temporarily disable it. Update your MBR and then return this value back to 0.
  <A name="Useful hints and advices"></A>
  <H3>
   Useful hints and advices
  </H3>
  <UL>
   <LI>Disable all MS-DOS disk caching programs before installing/configuring master boot sector with mbrbm.
   <LI>Disable BIOS write-protection on boot sector and master boot sector at installation time.
   After installation the boot sector is never modified again - the BIOS protection could be enabled again.
   There is NO need for configuration - even after moving or deleting/creating primary partitions.
   <LI>Always keep bootable floppy or CD with a backup of MBR. If for some reasons the MBR loader or (what is even worse)
   partition table is broken, you may restore it with the backup.
   <LI>When using Linux with LILO/GRUB it is reasonable to install LILO into boot record of a chosen partition, not MBR.
   Of course if you want to use mbrbm in the MBR instead.
   <LI>Installation of all known Windows operating systems overwrites MBR. You have to reinstall mbrbm after you install
   any Windows on any partition. Since boot record of a target partition is also updated by Windows installation routine
   it is safe to overwrite MBR contents with mbrbm - since mbrbm is only 438 bytes Windows's VolumeID is also preserved!
   Same with modern lilo's DiskID.
   <LI>Due to mbrbm restriction to 1024 cylinders be aware to keep your booting OS partitions ("/", "/boot", "C:\")
   within the first 8 Gigabyte - anyway a good idea to separate the root-filesystem (again "/", "/boot", "C:\") from
   all other data (applications and user data).

  If mbrbm does not work for some reason you may ask for support. What do you need to provide in order to get help:
  <OL>
   <LI>Is mbrbm installed properly? "dd if=/dev/hda bs=1 count=438 | md5sum" should match the mbrbm.md5 in the distribution tar
   <LI>Deinstall mbrbm - does the problem stay? Remember installation of mbrbm does only alter 438 bytes on the HD!
   <LI>Describe hardware configuration (disks subsystem: number of drives, their types (ATA, SATA, etc.), primary
   or secondary, sizes, etc.)
   <LI>Report the version of mbrbm you are using
   <LI>Explain the problem (crash, hanging, incorrect behavior, etc.)
   <LI>Describe partitioning scheme of your hard drives (sizes and filesystems on primary partitions and logical disks).
   Appropriate screenshots of fdisk may help as well.
   <LI>Provide a description of OSes you want to boot: where are they, how many oses you want to boot, what are they
   (brands+versions)
   <LI>What other boot-related software do you use (other boot managers for example on other hard disk, OS loaders like
   LILO, etc.)
  </OL>
  Not all items above are mandatory, but however if you provide quality feedback with much info describing your problem,
  I may help you with greater probability.
  <BR>
  But please don't forget - mbrbm is my hobby, there is no guarantee this software will work properly. I'm not responsible for
  any damage it may cause. Immediate support is also not guaranteed.
